Ryan Ishaug,"HoneyBee Herbs is a 5 star company for sure! Their quartz is amazing, tons of different bangers and nails. Also have seamless joint, the bucket and the stem are seamlessly created.  They’re a bit more expensive but well worth it for the quality.  Their milk and honey line is sexy and a comes in many different setups. Stock is good, some stuff sells out really fast but with the Post Office having issues I don’t think it has anything to do with HoneyBee.  I went with the thick original since I’m a bit clumsy, 4mm side walls and bottom, should be great for holding heat as well as any small accidents.  For the money there isn’t a better company out there. The quality is better than most others, all quartz, no corner cutting.  There’s a 25% off coupon for singing up, and on my first order both packages had coupons codes for 30% off my next order.  Check them out, they have a great website.",5,Ad

After completing diagnostic they found it was not the issue I thought I had and just needed a battery. They even had two choices of battery for me.

Both people I spoke to here where very personable and easy to talk to-no techy talking down to me going on here.

Hassan Raza,"Being an IMG with a medical training background so few applicants undergo and match successfully, made me realize how toxic this world can be.

In comes Dr. Desai. He helped me get on track, reassured me and dispelled most of the nonsense others were feeding me. With his help, and essentially making his The Successful Residency Match 2017 book my new Bible, I received 18 interview offers, excelled at them, and matched at my 2nd choice institution.

It's refreshing and filling, never greasy and comes with high quality vegetables, no baby corn, celery or water chestnuts and cabbage like some places try to get away with. It's a little pricey so I try to go for lunch when entrees are cheaper.

Joey Hunziker,"This review is based on the billing issues at Pahlavani dental. I received one notification in December 2018 about a bill in need of payment. I was confused, as I had changed jobs and therefore insurance, and hadn't visited Pahlavani dental in several months. I clicked through the email to see what the balance was due, but it showed me nothing. So I went on with my business.

Seven months later, I received a notification from a collections agency that Pahlavani dental sold that bill (which no one was still able to verify for me the amount). I called Pahlavani dental and they could neither confirm the amount nor who the creditor was, since they'd batch sold the debt. They were able to tell me that my insurance had retroactively denied one of their claims, which I was not notified about, and they were billing me for the service. I had to send them the name of the collection agency for them to confirm. I paid the stupid creditor $119 and yet now I have a negative impact on my credit because of Pahlavani's billing practices. I would not recommend dealing with this.",1,Rant

Alice Serra,"Lovely outfits, amazing app, great customer service.
For the quality of the material we should always check in “Details” there’s everything there to choose properly.

I placed 4 orders during the covid because all the shops in my area were closed. My baby was just born and I needed clothes. I waited for the first order very long time, but as soon as I wrote an email they immediately answered me back. With various options to resolve the issue.
When they sent the wrong size they gave me a full refund and they let me to keep the items to use as a gift for friends with that size. This was solved in 2 days Sunday and Monday.

In my opinion very remarkable.
The quality is very nice if you order clothes you should check the quality Of the material in the description. I bought a dress 100% cotton and it respected the expectations.

I’ve ordered the May 25/26 and received June 13. Very improved.",5,Valid

J Bona,"I love the designs available and that they're upfront about delivery times, measurements of sizes, materials, etc (at least for the three items I've purchased). I truly appreciate that when I wanted to return items that did not fit me as desired, Karen P was polite during email exchanges (despite there being a few steps to getting returns approved) and provided a full refund, without even requiring me to return the items due to the shipping costs. I'm hoping to pass on the dresses that didn't fit and win over some friends to patpat, once they've tried them :P",5,Valid

The problem, finding either that is manufactured in the U.S. Being part of a Search and Recovery unit, the product was needed. I'm just sorry GearAmerica has to rely on ROC for the manufacturing. These accesories will be my last orders with GearAmerica (kind of a stretch on that company name....).",1,Rant

This often translates into guests leaving positive public reviews. In situations where a guest's visit was not up to their expectations, Starloop allows us to learn this, and take appropriate steps with the guest and with our operations.  The icing on the cake is that a tree is planted for every review.",5,Ad

Ant Kev,"I was there for the first time for the Lady Gaga concert this past November, and I have to say that it's awesome that they make good use of the space in the middle with separate stages and moving bridges to have the performers walk across to all of them.

Getting around  to some seats can be very slow and a little confusing but that is not too atypical for an arena.
I also wish that they had more than just a few TV screens to see the different angles of the performance instead of just the one or two that stayed zoomed in on certain areas.  Just some suggestions for the future architects and interior designers!",4,Valid

Gunnar Gustafsson,"(Translated by Google) Very happy with my first order of 5 sets of baby clothes from you that were nicely packaged in nice bags. Ordered for large size deliberately. To be sure they would fit. Several garments were finer than in the pictures. Glad I chose a larger size as clothes that are stated in months / age sizes instead of centimeters differ a lot.
Not happy with the company that delivered the package. Early Bird as they are called. They had put only half of the bag of clothes tucked in the mailbox - despite the fact that there was room to put the bag down completely. It was pouring rain outside. Anyone could have passed by and stolen the bag from the mailbox outside our plot. Would have preferred it to be delivered to the nearest agent where you can pick up your package yourself.

Mycket nöjd med min första beställning av  5 set babykläder från er som var fint paketerade i fina påsar. Beställde för stor storlek medvetet. För att vara säker att de skulle passa. Flera plagg var finare än på bilderna. Glad jag valde större storlek då kläder som anges i månader/åldersstorlekar istället för centimeter skiljer sig åt mycket.
Inte nöjd med företaget som levererade paketet. Early Bird som de heter. De hade lagt påsen med kläder endast till hälften nedstoppat i brevlådan - trots det fanns plats att stoppa ner påsen helt. Det ösregnade ute. Vem som  helst hade kunnat gå förbi och stjäla påsen från brevlådan utanför vår tomt.  Hade hellre velat att det levererats till närmaste ombud där man själv kan hämta ut sitt paket.",5,Valid

The problem of pat pat is that they sew some clothes using fabrics of poor quality. I recieved package, And some of them vere good, and nice, but most of them weren’t good. By the way, clothes’ve been sewn properly, the quality of sewing is superb, but the fabrics... You should do something with this and the rest will be Ok.",4,Valid
