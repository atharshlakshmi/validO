Derrick Phillips,Three years ago I had a car accident and I needed immediate help to cover lost wages. Fast Funds swooped in to the rescue and advanced me money to survive. It is 3 years later now my case is settled and Fast Funds got their money back. I must say that 3 years without worrying about making a loan payment or getting collection calls is well worth the fee. I absolutely love what they did to help and would recommend them to anyone waiting on the evil insurance companies to make things whole again.,5,Valid
It's For Sale Main Account,"I wish I could give Jason and Fast Funds 10 stars for the Open & Honest way he conducted business with me.  The level of service was Exceptional.

There are many businesses designed to help people when they are in a less-than advantageous position.  Often, as customers in need of funds to sustain our living expenses we are desperate and have exhausted our resources leaving us few places to turn to and no power in the business relationship.

A businessman who suffered 3 heart failures over the last 18 months and the loss of my career as a result, this certainly was the case with me.

As a company, Fast Funds clearly understands their clientele and how to do this business right.

Design your business model in such a way that you are able to charge reasonable rates to your clients and still conduct business in a fair, ethical manner.

Hire good people with a high level of personal integrity and treat them with the same respect you insist they treat their clients with.  Pay them a wage sufficient to attract and keep quality employees and operate under a system that allows them to keep their integrity intact.

Jason was clear about the cost of the advance from the beginning.  The fee structure is easy to understand and there are no hidden charges or complicated scenarios to confuse the client.

As mentioned, the level of service was superb.  Highlighted by Jason's willingness to be helpful, answer questions, sometimes a little after hours.  He was clear about the process and what to expect without any hesitation that he may be held accountable for the statements he made.

I have been the owner of a service company with 30 employees and the manager of many others.  My name is Tom Hansen and I received my lawsuit advance December 17th, 2019.  My glowing review was earned each step of the way by Jason and the good people at Fast Funds of Hollywood, Florida.",5,Valid

Sister King,"To whom this may concern,
Recently, I was injured on the job. Stressed about apartment eviction and car/ insurance payments. These three are my biggest bills. After praying about my burdens, I then turned to my lawyer Mr. John Dufour. With his years of experience and affiliation with the company by the name of ""Fast Funds"" which are owned and operated by Mr. Bruce and Jason. Fast funds specializes in settlement cash advances. What does that mean? Its a financial relief for anyone who's injured. With that injury comes with a settlement offer. Well, from first hand it takes time to accumulate all the evidence in your situation. That's when hard times hit and you should contact ""Fast Funds"" where Bruce/Jason will be more than happy to assist you in your financial situation. If it wasn't for these three Angels I would be homeless, Literally! God places people in your life for a reason and these three Angels have been a blessing to my life. So stop worrying about what's already been solved. Go ahead and give ""Fast Funds"" a try Today!",5,Irrelevant

Seth Walker,"I have always admired AO's builds and had one day hoped to get my car in their shop for upgrades. Before I could do that, I ran out of talent and wadded up the front end on my RZR cracking the frame in the process. I called Alternative the following day (on a Sunday) and surprisingly James answered my call. He answered all my questions and walked me through the whole insurance process without even expecting me to bring my car to him. It was like we had known each other for years.

The shop is a couple hours from me but was well worth the drive. I ended up having a lot of problems with my insurance company dropping the ball and jacking me around. James was super patient, helped me out a ton with all the issues, was up front about every detail, and finally my RZR came back looking like nothing ever happened even with a full frame swap. They went above and beyond to clean up all my wiring that another ""shop"" had slapped together.

Their pics speak for themselves. Believe me when I say their work is very clean and thorough. Solid team of guys that do things right the first time. Extremely hard to find in this industry.

Highly recommend!",5,Valid

Charmian McKeown,"Horrendous experience

Ordered an expensive desk from Homary and was told 9 - 11 week delivery time. It took 21 weeks. I was very happy to wait and was very understanding due to the COVID situation however when the desk finally arrived, it was only one piece, with no legs! I was then told the remaining legs would arrive in 9 - 11 weeks again, but may be longer. I could not wait another 21 weeks as I work from home and have no where to sit!

I politely asked for a refund as I couldn't wait any longer and would just purchase a cheaper desk for now that could be delivered quickly.

I have only been refunded a partial amount and no idea why, as I should get the full refund - they are now ignoring my communications.

However the most frustrating and rude part of this process is that after my understanding for 21 weeks, I asked for the large/heavy piece of unusable desk they delivered to be picked up - I cannot move it and it is taking up my entire hall. I was told I have to ""dispose of it"". I explained it is too heavy and I can't afford to get someone to come and get it, I was then told to ""Ask family or friends to help"". I have no family or friends living near me and I found this so unhelpful and pretty assumptive and upsetting. It is now sitting in my hallway as a health and safety hazard, I am ¬£80 down as they haven't paid me a full refund and I have to order anew desk to work from after waiting 21 weeks.

I never review companies online as I understand mistakes happen but I wouldn't want anyone else to deal with this incompetent company.

They brought at least 6 fans and several extra humidifiers they charged insurance extra for which were never working.

They stole military service medals, sunglasses, and several other small items. When I confronted the head technician David Renteria, he said they broke into my garage to use the power outlet.

Kirsten Reeder,"Our son likes making music, so we signed him up for a summer camp at Mix Major. He loved it! The teaching of skills and interaction with other kids was great for him. He's now taking weekly classes, has created several songs, and because of what he's learned and the confidence it's given him he created an entire album of music. We love that the students use professional software and are learning skills that are up to date and used is the music production industry today.

Eric truly cares for his students and that's what makes him and his school so special.",5,Valid
George Cheng,"Our child has really enjoyed Mix Major's DJ'ing/music production program!  It started with a summer camp a few summers ago but since we are not local, we could not attend the regular weekday classes.  It was great to see Eric be so adaptive during the pandemic and really grow his online platform to allow our child to now attend the weekly classes.  There aren't too many silver linings from this pandemic but this is one of few.  It's neat to see kids with similar music interests from all over the country now in these classes.  Eric has also arranged, from time to time, extra workshops exposing the students to a variety of people in the music industry which gives the students a wider perspective of real life applications that are possible from these classes.  Our child in general would not sit still long enough to appreciate regular musical instrument lessons but this program has helped to increase the interest in music. Our piano is getting more use now and  there is a much higher level of excitement for orchestra class in middle school.  Who know where this class can take our child, but the new appreciation for music and instruments makes the program well worth it.",5,Valid

Eric/Mr Jao is a great instructor and he is so positive and encouraging with all of the kids. When they share their music he is bopping his head to their tunes. The assistants he has are great teachers as well and help the kids navigate the software. Eric also teaches some music theory and technical terms to the kids. In the camp, they make albums and my son loves sharing his album with his friends.

Ardeshir Edward Nadimi,"I was referred by a friend to Eric to help me learn how to produce electronic music.

We started with an introductory call and then an introductory course, during which he provided me direct teaching on the Ableton Live DAW to come up with a song from a prepared set of audio samples he had sent me to download prior to the session. This was all handled via the Zoom platform.

I decided to join his class on the spot, as I knew I had found someone who was very well-versed in 1-using Ableton, 2-producing electronic music, and 3-teaching.

I have been a teacher in the past, and have spent much of my adult life as a learner. It is easy for me to tell when someone has the patience, foresight, and knowledge to teach well. Eric fits the bill on all fronts.

From the music production side: I have not felt this alive in many years. Granted, I have had the goal of music production for more than a decade and I am just now getting around to seriously pursuing it. However, I think my experience is likely generalizable and not strictly confined to those who want to pursue music production seriously. The sheer act of creatively ""playing"" with music is something I think is probably built into the human psyche and human experience, and this class provides an outlet for that kind of artistic/human expression

Finally, I will say that in my brief dealings with Eric so far, I can tell that he has a kind heart and is truly trying to make the world a better -- and more music-filled -- place, one music-producer at a time.",5,Valid

Such a seamless process and we loved our photos so we decided to book her for our sons 1 year pictures. Leslie was in contact with me from the start, and even helped me with ideas and offered to bring items that we needed and/or add purchases to our package.
As a working mom who had no time to plan, she made everything perfect!!! I also appreciated her honestly about timing, weather, location, cake details, outfit changes.... etc.
Fast forward to receiving our pics, I was AMAZED!! She captured EVERYTHING and made it all look absolutely perfect!!

If you‚Äôre looking for a honest, EXTREAMLY  talented photographer/storyteller.... PICK LESLIE!!

The communication was great throughout the whole service. Upon arrival to the shoot, she was ready for us. She had all the props, a portable changing station, the outfits and she was ready when we were. I was so nervous to be taking pictures with my husband. The last time we had pictures taken were for our wedding day, but she had us feel comfortable, confident and really helped my husband and I find that connection that will stay with us in these pictures. After the shoot, she made sure to answer any questions we had and let us know when to expect the pictures. When I got the email that my photos were ready to view, all i could say was WOW! i mean, they were stunning.. she captured every emotion, and perfect imperfect moments of our shoot that really screamed us!

Eric came out first and tried everything he could to fix the issue, even called someone to help with the problem- very professional, early, great communication, did not rush through the job at all. Unfortunately, the problem was complex and returned. Gilbert came out next- professional, patient, took time to walk me through and trouble shoot the problem, and explained everything along the way. He ended up fixing the issue and gave me advice on next steps should it return. The problem hasn't returned! I would definitely use this company again, and highly recommend it to anyone having electrical issues. Overall- easy to schedule, respectful, on time, professional. I had called a lot of electricians, and this company was one of the only ones that responded professionally.",5,Valid
Philip Ardery,"Before finding Five or Free, I was struggling to work with another (perhaps *the*) top rated electrician in Oakland.  It was like pulling teeth just trying to schedule a visit with those people.  Communicating with them over missed phone calls and endless misunderstandings was just too much to bare, so I started looking for other solutions.

Five or Free sent out a technician names Tim very quickly to review the situation.  He was punctual, incredibly nice, and very patient and informative when explaining to me how the wiring was set up in my newly purchased home.  He presented me with multiple different options for moving forward at different price points, and wasn't pushy at all in going one way or the other.

Then, when Tim came back to do the actual work, some further analysis revealed that some of the scheduled work didn't in fact need to be done.  He made me immediately aware of this and reduced the cost of the visit accordingly.  Some less honest technicians may have simply said nothing and billed me for work they didn't eve do.

This is all I really need to say.  They were quick, punctual, very easy to work/communicate with, and just all around good people.  We will definitely be using them exclusively from here on out.

Thanks Tim!",5,Valid

In fact there was no power to that outlet!!  One phone call and Emmanuel was ringing the doorbell!!  After a  thorough review of our situation he made a recommendation that involved making our old knob and tube wiring safe without rewiring the whole house and putting in overhead wiring for an overhead lamp.  The next morning Josh and his crew showed up before 9 and worked tirelessly the whole day...  no stopping for lunch!!!  Their communication was flawless!!!

Lawrence Rice,"When I was preparing my house for sale, a home inspector surprised me by informing me the electrical panel was substandard and needed replacement.  The first contractor I contacted, a specialist in such replacements, told me the panel had to be moved to meet code, the only suitable spot was in front of the house, but the City would not approve placement there due to esthetics.  He advised me to apply for a variance with the Planning department, which he predicted would take five months, and after that to call him again.  Needless to say, I checked with multiple other contractors and heard other opinions, but did not find one I trusted who seemed to know what they were talking about and quoted a reasonable price.  They all expected me to obtain approvals from the electrical supplier and government entities before they would start work.  Finally, I called Five or Free Electric.
The experience with Five or Free was a cut above all the others. They were prompt, confident, knowledgeable, and assured me they would handle any and all contact with government inspectors.  Their price was comparable with that quoted by the ‚Äúexpert‚Äù I had first talked with.  Above all, they were true to their word, performing excellent work in accord with the timetable they had proposed.  Gilbert, Josh, Allan and Tim were all courteous, prompt, helpful and totally professional.  Ethan did a great job managing the project.

Kathy Youngquist,"Correcting Electrical Wiring Upgrade Mistakes in a 1958 Home:

1) Knowledgeable/Thorough/Detailed/Meticulous/ Methodical - carefully inspected and corrected the wiring problems caused by the previous electrician, including the problems in the dark, narrow, cramped, crawl space under the house.

2) Professional/Great Customer Service - accommodated 2 work schedules, text reminders, arrival updates, arrived in a timely manner, polite, neat, tidy.

3) Patient/ Pleasant - had many lengthy discussions with us to make sure that we understood what, why and how they planned to repair the previous electrician's wiring mistakes.  Took before and after photos because we lived out-of-town.

Geraldine B,"Frankly, I've not had very good experiences with the electricians. I came across Five or Free Electrical online... Now that they've come out a few times it's time to write a review:
Five or Free is an all-around first class company. The whole process has been thought out, from initial contact to mailing inspection permits. They EXPERTLY replaced an out-dated sub panel (which was a fire risk and no small task), and installed an EVSE from the main panel to the garage. The EVSE installation required a bit of logistics and some de-construction/construction. The result is that it's in just the right place for ease of use and looks very nice.
I asked one technician how to approach garage door repair companies and his great advice was a bonus. The folks at Five or Free are communicative, professional, honest, and most importantly, the electricians do excellent work. It's a pleasure doing business with them.",5,Valid

Aivlys Ojelomram,"I made an appointment and was required to leave a $40 deposit to save my spot at 1pm which would also be deducted from the total price for hair service. But if I wouldn't show up to my appointment at scheduled time, I would loose the $40. Come the day of my appointment and I was not seen till 3:15pm, then when the stylist finally finished with my hair, she told me the total was $110, I then reminded her to deduct the $40 to which she stated she had forgotten about it. So she then charged me $90, but $110 minus $40 should be $70. So stylist didn't keep her appointment time for me which I made a $40 deposit for, she also charged me more than she should have after deducting the deposit. After she finished with my hairstyle, I asked her when did i need to come in again for touch up and she made an appointment for me for approximately 54 days later and stated that's when I would need a touch up. But the color only lasted 8 days on my hair. This is very unprofessional all from her charging $40 deposit and not keeping the time, not deducting the $40 deposit from total price and hair color not lasting but 8 days and not providing a solution for this. Totally bad customer service and bad experience. This is not right at all.",1,Rant

Joan Roberts,"Reichen Refinishing was hired to complete a difficult project on a historic 1852 home that had soft pine floors.

Kenton came out for an estimate promptly and ed provided several facts and figures to work with, including a schedule of availability. He started shortly thereafter.

He performed the job himself with one helper. This is unusual as most contractors farm their work out to underlings and rarely show up on the job except to collect payment.

The work was completed quickly and professionally. Kenton was very easy to work with and flexible knowing that there was some uncertainty as to  how exactly the project was going to come out. The ultimate results were excellent. His prices were reasonable and although it was doubted whether we could keep the original floors, he made them come back to life and preserve our historic property.

Interviewing some other companies they were going to cut corners on the filling, only doing a partial fill, and had some had sceptical recommendations on inferior acrylic products, or tried to not even fill at all.  Kenton listened and worked with me to use a high quality filler product which was not available locally, and troweled my whole floor.

I feel amazing and definitely  more rested the next day. Ordering online was easy, quick and I got free shipping.

Sleep Complex really helps me recover from the previous day, more focused, less stressed and there's zero groggy feeling the next morning. I highly recommend this Sleep Complex Melatonin Spray to anyone who has problems falling asleep and wants to feel great the next day.",5,Valid

The positives: Server management is easy and during their opening hours their support livechat is responsive.

Negatives: Multiple periods of downtime, some days in length. Discounts on future bills don't really make up for not being able to use my server. My server has been migrated onto a new machine/assigned a new IP at least once without me being notified resulting in me having to update domain DNS records. The company seems to have a cult like following who jump on anyone who has a genuine complaint and tries to raise this via their discord.

I have used other hosts in the past and could easily host the server myself, but thought it would remove the hassle by using a professional serer host. It did not.

Liko,"So just for a heads-up, this was posted on Trust Pilot, but was removed.

I was paying for the Herobrine package, which is ""unlimited"" RAM. I read the terms on that prior to purchasing: starts at 8gb and gets increased in increments of 2 up to 16gb, as needed. Fine, thats alright. I was expecting to need about 12 for my SMP server.

I opted for the upgraded support & management package, an extra $5/mo. This comes with +1 GB of ram for your server, neat.

Immediately upon starting my server for the first time (we transferred the world from a different host)- we were instantly struck with server issues. I requested more RAM, and they obliged- taking us up from 8 to 10. I then asked about my +1 from the extra package, which they said was applied as a +1 to the 8, bringing us to 9- then the ticket went through for 8-10, bringing our total up to 10. I lost my +1, Irritating, but oh well. At least I have upgraded support, right?

During this time, the server got a little bit better- the usage statistics were implemented on the panel. They are wildly inaccurate. It would say our RAM was constantly maxed out and our CPU never reached above 1-2%. When I asked support they said that Its ""not a measure of what is being used, but rather what is available, I can assure you that you're not using all of your RAM."" All the while our server was nearing 400-500 ticks behind, constantly.

I opened several support tickets, one on my subdomain not working, one on players unable to connect through the IP address (only some players, despite being whitelisted), and on server performance (which I only did because their live chat support would urge me to write a ticket). Ticket response times were upwards of FOUR days.

Live chat and support ran me in circles trying to swap my server off of vanilla and adding plugins to control lag, which I begrudgingly did- nothing improved. Then, upon requesting RAM once again they told me that the server was not using its current resources and this could not be granted.

Austin Becker,"The best. Hands down. If you are an acoustic enthusiast, a performer, a master--your guitar is here. I thought I'd heard every nuance of acoustic guitar and then I went to Guitar Gallery. Not even close. These instruments are meticulously crafted and cared for. The shop is pristine. The guitars are all in excellent condition and the range of builders is wide.
Established builders, newcomers, obscure . . . all excellent.

I've done business with Robin the owner through 4 guitars now. The transactions are always perfect and without hassle. The biggest challenge is buying only one because they are all amazing and unique.

Great service, great inventory, and it's easy to purchase even if you can't make it to the shop. Love this place.",5,Valid
Nicki Maguire,"I can‚Äôt say enough about the service, the level of professionalism and the quality of all of the beautiful guitars / instruments at Guitar Gallery.

I have personally invested in one of the handcrafted Telecasters that was in store. I love every moment I spend playing on it. The owner is extremely knowledgeable and encourages you to try several of these beauties, both electric and acoustic until you find the one that fits and works best for you. Regardless of your level of experience, there is something here for every budget.

The updated website is easy to navigate. It has beautiful precise pictures, as well as audio and descriptions to accompany the instrument of your choice.

They never fix anything and once you sign the lease they will not return all calls. I got suckered in this place.. Move in day the place still wasn't ready. Wasn't properly cleaned, no smoke detectors, no pest control for the nice big flying roaches here. No washer dryer hook up and the laundromat here smells like piss and armpits. They tried to upgrade this place but management needs to be changed... Oh yea.. There's also lead paint that's peeling off with the 37 new layers they smothered on top. No playground nasty pools and teenagers outside 24-7. Its funny.. Most of the cars in the parking lot are nice... You would think they would get rid of the riffraff and actually have maintenance fix the units they just redid. But all their worried about here is getting more people in this place. And the water out of the tap smells and tastes like pool water. Thats a flavor that gets into all the food and dries out your skin like nobody's business. Go somewhere else.

I ordered a mirror from Glassupply.com on May 24th because they gave me a delivery date of May 29th and I needed the mirror before the weekend.  I received no shipping information/tracking on the 24th, 25th, or the 26th.  So on the 26th I emailed and asked them if they could let me know if my mirror had been shipped and here is the response I got.

""Hi jerodhowell79, order refunded""

They gave no reason, i.e. ""I'm sorry we didn't ship your item"", ""Sorry, your order got lost"", ""Covid-19 has slowed our deliveries""  Nothing like that at all, just ""order refunded"".

Then when I get my refund they write in the notes ""Covid-19""  What does Covid-19 have to do with getting you order out on time?  Yeah blame Covid-19 if the shipment is delayed, but it wasn't, because it never shipped.

If you are OK with being treated this way, chasing down shipments and don't mind waiting for your glass and mirror products then I'm sure Glassupply.com will be great for you, but for me, I demand better.

Aquilah Nixon,"Dream Team on the Move is EXCELLENT! From my initial email inquiry back in April 2021 when I decided to not renew my lease; they were responsive in less than 24 hours thanking me for my inquiry and requested an itemized list.

They also asked if I needed my bed (part of my itemized list) disassembled and reassembled (something I completely forgot about) at no extra charge - wow! Other places had a fee for the furniture assembly process.

All of my questions were answered immediately within less than 24 hours and Esa (the owner) checked in with me periodically from April 2021-June 2021 to see if I needed anything else as well as confirmed my move with me 3 days prior to the scheduled move date in June 2021.

Esa and another gentleman arrived 15 minutes early to ensure logistics (e.g. where to park so they could load my stuff, elevator access, time my move-in appointment, etc.) and began to work immediately. Sooo friendly and genuinely cared about helping me as much as possible given I live alone. Great conversations while packing and both had such a great spirit (did I forget to mention it was 100 degrees outside - yikes!).

The entire process I was extremely happy with both of my movers :) HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!! You will not be disappointed!!!!!!!

Very affordable rates and honestly (for me and my needs) the best price in the DMV area.

They do not allow refunds or even partial credits for advance purchases of subscription months paid well in advance.

We missed the annual renewal by only a matter of weeks and now I am having to pay for a years worth of services I do not need because we went out of business.

I am extremely hurting financially due to this advance purchase and after repeated attempts to try and come to a reasonable compromise they refused. Not even a single dollar refunded for any future months.

Joe Maloney,"Loved the demo of this product.  Entered a credit card for ""free trial"" and everyone disappeared, no ""free trial"" and cannot access site to cancel the account.  The only screen I have seen from this software site is ""oops, something must have slipped through the cracks"" about 15 times.  What software engineer thought that would be a helpful dialog box?  This is the experience when they are attempting to sell the software, I don't believe I will stick around to see what their ""customer service"" is like AFTER the sale.",1,Rant
Brandon Peltz,Awesome Software! Couldn't be happier with how easy it was to manage my inventory. Create and build new quotes in under a minute and have it do all the math and calculations for me. Plus it can organize all my conversations with a client and link it to the project it's associated with. Super helpful for my clients that i have multiple future jobs with. So far I only have 3 accounts for my sales staff but am planing to get more limited users for my warehouse crew so we can all be on the same page all the time. They said limited user's won't see any pricing so I'm excited to check that out. Keep it up Goodshuffle! :),5,Valid

After searching for a while, they finally found the post-it note our order was written on. Unfortunately, nothing had been done with it, and they didn't have the flowers we needed.

Sarah Hagler Findley,"I used to respect this flower shop because their online designs were great and their customer service was good the one time I used them. So I considered myself a return customer today when I ordered a ""petite, compact arrangement of wildflowers that is easy to transport and compact like the 'Evergreen' option on the website, featuring white daisies.""  I didn't balk at the $75 charge they quoted me.
After the bouquet arrived and my sister sent me a photo, I challenged them on charging me me too much for a disappointing arrangement. They informed me the only solution was to go back to my recipient and TAKE THEM AWAY FROM  HER. Haha! And in order to give her something else in return, they'd charge me extra for delivering a satisfactory bouquet!
I spent $75 today to get a basic arrangement that, in my experience in the industry, cost about $40, and came in one of those cheesy vases the crappy online florists mail for free. And the only solution they offered, after arguing with me, was to take away my sister's flowers!
I'd be even angrier if I wasn't so entertained by Nosegay's ridiculous solution to their mistake and poor judgement. I sent them a photo and in the end, they stood by the ""designer"" and put the customer last. If you want my opinion, order off the website ONLY and hope you don't get the same ""designer"" I got. ... because my sister is sitting at work with an oversized, poorly shaped collection of cheap flowers, which I'm still trying to decide is worse than no flowers at all. #disappointment #customerservicefail",1,Rant

Estimate to fix was $480. Today while mechanic started working on it the problem was actually discovered to be all eight cylinders misfiring.

bob joe,"Sold me a car with NO AIRBAGS to turn a quick dollar.

I payed $3600 cash for a car from these scammers.

Drove it around, everything was fine except about 20 minutes into the ride home the ""chime"" started going off. (sound you hear when your door is still open or your seatbelt is not on).. It chimes 15 times and than stops for a while than it will start again when the car starts.

A google search says that the 15 beeps means that there is a problem with either the airbags or the instrument panel.

I found a mysterious bolt laying on the floorboard when i bought the car.
Open up the instrument panel to check, and low and behold the Airbag LED had been crushed with some tool probably needle nose pliers.

The bolt i had found on the ground was 1 of the 4 that holds the instrument panel to the dash (there was only 3 on when i opened it)- MEANING that Everage auto was fully aware that the vehicle did not have airbags - or there was an issue causing the Airbag check light to display, and they knew it would turn off a potential buyer so they sabotaged it.

Needless to say I took the car back and got my money back.
