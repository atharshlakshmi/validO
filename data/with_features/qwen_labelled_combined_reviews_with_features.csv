It's For Sale Main Account,"I wish I could give Jason and Fast Funds 10 stars for the Open & Honest way he conducted business with me.  The level of service was Exceptional.

There are many businesses designed to help people when they are in a less-than advantageous position.  Often, as customers in need of funds to sustain our living expenses we are desperate and have exhausted our resources leaving us few places to turn to and no power in the business relationship.

A businessman who suffered 3 heart failures over the last 18 months and the loss of my career as a result, this certainly was the case with me.

As a company, Fast Funds clearly understands their clientele and how to do this business right.

Design your business model in such a way that you are able to charge reasonable rates to your clients and still conduct business in a fair, ethical manner.

Hire good people with a high level of personal integrity and treat them with the same respect you insist they treat their clients with.  Pay them a wage sufficient to attract and keep quality employees and operate under a system that allows them to keep their integrity intact.

Jason was clear about the cost of the advance from the beginning.  The fee structure is easy to understand and there are no hidden charges or complicated scenarios to confuse the client.

As mentioned, the level of service was superb.  Highlighted by Jason's willingness to be helpful, answer questions, sometimes a little after hours.  He was clear about the process and what to expect without any hesitation that he may be held accountable for the statements he made.

I have been the owner of a service company with 30 employees and the manager of many others.  My name is Tom Hansen and I received my lawsuit advance December 17th, 2019.

James was super patient, helped me out a ton with all the issues, was up front about every detail, and finally my RZR came back looking like nothing ever happened even with a full frame swap. They went above and beyond to clean up all my wiring that another ""shop"" had slapped together.

Charmian McKeown,"Horrendous experience

Ordered an expensive desk from Homary and was told 9 - 11 week delivery time. It took 21 weeks. I was very happy to wait and was very understanding due to the COVID situation however when the desk finally arrived, it was only one piece, with no legs! I was then told the remaining legs would arrive in 9 - 11 weeks again, but may be longer. I could not wait another 21 weeks as I work from home and have no where to sit!

I politely asked for a refund as I couldn't wait any longer and would just purchase a cheaper desk for now that could be delivered quickly.

I have only been refunded a partial amount and no idea why, as I should get the full refund - they are now ignoring my communications.

However the most frustrating and rude part of this process is that after my understanding for 21 weeks, I asked for the large/heavy piece of unusable desk they delivered to be picked up - I cannot move it and it is taking up my entire hall. I was told I have to ""dispose of it"". I explained it is too heavy and I can't afford to get someone to come and get it, I was then told to ""Ask family or friends to help"". I have no family or friends living near me and I found this so unhelpful and pretty assumptive and upsetting. It is now sitting in my hallway as a health and safety hazard, I am £80 down as they haven't paid me a full refund and I have to order anew desk to work from after waiting 21 weeks.

I never review companies online as I understand mistakes happen but I wouldn't want anyone else to deal with this incompetent company.

Eric/Mr Jao is a great instructor and he is so positive and encouraging with all of the kids. When they share their music he is bopping his head to their tunes. The assistants he has are great teachers as well and help the kids navigate the software. Eric also teaches some music theory and technical terms to the kids. In the camp, they make albums and my son loves sharing his album with his friends.

Ardeshir Edward Nadimi,"I was referred by a friend to Eric to help me learn how to produce electronic music.

We started with an introductory call and then an introductory course, during which he provided me direct teaching on the Ableton Live DAW to come up with a song from a prepared set of audio samples he had sent me to download prior to the session. This was all handled via the Zoom platform.

I decided to join his class on the spot, as I knew I had found someone who was very well-versed in 1-using Ableton, 2-producing electronic music, and 3-teaching.

I have been a teacher in the past, and have spent much of my adult life as a learner. It is easy for me to tell when someone has the patience, foresight, and knowledge to teach well. Eric fits the bill on all fronts.

From the music production side: I have not felt this alive in many years. Granted, I have had the goal of music production for more than a decade and I am just now getting around to seriously pursuing it. However, I think my experience is likely generalizable and not strictly confined to those who want to pursue music production seriously. The sheer act of creatively ""playing"" with music is something I think is probably built into the human psyche and human experience, and this class provides an outlet for that kind of artistic/human expression

Such a seamless process and we loved our photos so we decided to book her for our sons 1 year pictures. Leslie was in contact with me from the start, and even helped me with ideas and offered to bring items that we needed and/or add purchases to our package.
As a working mom who had no time to plan, she made everything perfect!!! I also appreciated her honestly about timing, weather, location, cake details, outfit changes.... etc.
Fast forward to receiving our pics, I was AMAZED!! She captured EVERYTHING and made it all look absolutely perfect!!

The last time we had pictures taken were for our wedding day, but she had us feel comfortable, confident and really helped my husband and I find that connection that will stay with us in these pictures. After the shoot, she made sure to answer any questions we had and let us know when to expect the pictures.

Luz Brown,"This review is long overdue. I called Five Or Free Electrical Solutions because my circuit breaker kept tripping a couple of months ago. Eric came out first and tried everything he could to fix the issue, even called someone to help with the problem- very professional, early, great communication, did not rush through the job at all. Unfortunately, the problem was complex and returned. Gilbert came out next- professional, patient, took time to walk me through and trouble shoot the problem, and explained everything along the way.

Philip Ardery,"Before finding Five or Free, I was struggling to work with another (perhaps *the*) top rated electrician in Oakland.  It was like pulling teeth just trying to schedule a visit with those people.  Communicating with them over missed phone calls and endless misunderstandings was just too much to bare, so I started looking for other solutions.

Five or Free sent out a technician names Tim very quickly to review the situation.  He was punctual, incredibly nice, and very patient and informative when explaining to me how the wiring was set up in my newly purchased home.  He presented me with multiple different options for moving forward at different price points, and wasn't pushy at all in going one way or the other.

Then, when Tim came back to do the actual work, some further analysis revealed that some of the scheduled work didn't in fact need to be done.  He made me immediately aware of this and reduced the cost of the visit accordingly.  Some less honest technicians may have simply said nothing and billed me for work they didn't eve do.

This is all I really need to say.  They were quick, punctual, very easy to work/communicate with, and just all around good people.  We will definitely be using them exclusively from here on out.

Lawrence Rice,"When I was preparing my house for sale, a home inspector surprised me by informing me the electrical panel was substandard and needed replacement.  The first contractor I contacted, a specialist in such replacements, told me the panel had to be moved to meet code, the only suitable spot was in front of the house, but the City would not approve placement there due to esthetics.  He advised me to apply for a variance with the Planning department, which he predicted would take five months, and after that to call him again.  Needless to say, I checked with multiple other contractors and heard other opinions, but did not find one I trusted who seemed to know what they were talking about and quoted a reasonable price.  They all expected me to obtain approvals from the electrical supplier and government entities before they would start work.  Finally, I called Five or Free Electric.
The experience with Five or Free was a cut above all the others. They were prompt, confident, knowledgeable, and assured me they would handle any and all contact with government inspectors.  Their price was comparable with that quoted by the “expert” I had first talked with.  Above all, they were true to their word, performing excellent work in accord with the timetable they had proposed.  Gilbert, Josh, Allan and Tim were all courteous, prompt, helpful and totally professional.  Ethan did a great job managing the project.

The negative reviews are 100% accurate. David Chelf is dishonest. He doesn’t take care of his customers. He has zero service after purchase.  Google David Chelf, his reputation is clearly stated in his internet presence.  And if your in the marijuana industry, forget about support. Forget about how to heating at night, in the winter etc. forget about light drop. Reach out to his current customers for your own review.  Hibuddy organis in Arizona will tell your the same.

Liz Smith,"I was introduced to Lat and Lo a few years ago when my sister gifted me one of their bar necklaces with the coordinates and dates of my wedding. It was so sweet and thoughtful and to this day my favorite piece of jewelry to wear. I always get comments on it when I wear it out (which is most of the time). The jewelry is high quality and has withstood all of my poor care... Beach? Yes. Showers? Yes. Accidentally tangling it in knots in my luggage? No, but... they fixed it after I emailed to explain what happened (many frustrating hours trying to do it myself later) and how much it meant to me. They showed they cared and replaced my chain completely and I think did something to make it prettier because I swear it came back like new.(that may be my imagination but I love it).

So she then charged me $90, but $110 minus $40 should be $70. So stylist didn't keep her appointment time for me which I made a $40 deposit for, she also charged me more than she should have after deducting the deposit.

We had tile over linoleum in our kitchen and I asked them to match our existing narrow plank oak hardwood and put it all on the same level. In addition, they refinished the entirety of the rest of the house so it is all “brand new”. They were courteous and friendly, nice to my crazy dogs, and super communicative about their schedule and mine, making sure I was informed every step of the way. Most importantly they did a stellar job with both the refinishing and the newly installed kitchen floor. I would give them 10 stars if I could!

Liko,"So just for a heads-up, this was posted on Trust Pilot, but was removed.

I was paying for the Herobrine package, which is ""unlimited"" RAM. I read the terms on that prior to purchasing: starts at 8gb and gets increased in increments of 2 up to 16gb, as needed. Fine, thats alright. I was expecting to need about 12 for my SMP server.

I opted for the upgraded support & management package, an extra $5/mo. This comes with +1 GB of ram for your server, neat.

Immediately upon starting my server for the first time (we transferred the world from a different host)- we were instantly struck with server issues. I requested more RAM, and they obliged- taking us up from 8 to 10. I then asked about my +1 from the extra package, which they said was applied as a +1 to the 8, bringing us to 9- then the ticket went through for 8-10, bringing our total up to 10. I lost my +1, Irritating, but oh well. At least I have upgraded support, right?

During this time, the server got a little bit better- the usage statistics were implemented on the panel. They are wildly inaccurate. It would say our RAM was constantly maxed out and our CPU never reached above 1-2%. When I asked support they said that Its ""not a measure of what is being used, but rather what is available, I can assure you that you're not using all of your RAM."" All the while our server was nearing 400-500 ticks behind, constantly.

I opened several support tickets, one on my subdomain not working, one on players unable to connect through the IP address (only some players, despite being whitelisted), and on server performance (which I only did because their live chat support would urge me to write a ticket). Ticket response times were upwards of FOUR days.

Live chat and support ran me in circles trying to swap my server off of vanilla and adding plugins to control lag, which I begrudgingly did- nothing improved. Then, upon requesting RAM once again they told me that the server was not using its current resources and this could not be granted.

I cannot in good conscience recommend MCProHosting, especially at that price point.",1,Irrelevant,"so just for a headsup this was posted on trust pilot but was removed

during this time the server got a little bit better the usage statistics were implemented on the panel they are wildly inaccurate it would say our ram was constantly maxed out and our cpu never reached above  when i asked support they said that its not a measure of what is being used but rather what is available i can assure you that youre not using all of your ram all the while our server was nearing  ticks behind constantly

i opened several support tickets one on my subdomain not working one on players unable to connect through the ip address only some players despite being whitelisted and on server performance which i only did because their live chat support would urge me to write a ticket ticket response times were upwards of four days

live chat and support ran me in circles trying to swap my server off of vanilla and adding plugins to control lag which i begrudgingly did nothing improved then upon requesting ram once again they told me that the server was not using its current resources and this could not be granted

They also asked if I needed my bed (part of my itemized list) disassembled and reassembled (something I completely forgot about) at no extra charge - wow! Other places had a fee for the furniture assembly process.

All of my questions were answered immediately within less than 24 hours and Esa (the owner) checked in with me periodically from April 2021-June 2021 to see if I needed anything else as well as confirmed my move with me 3 days prior to the scheduled move date in June 2021.

Sooo friendly and genuinely cared about helping me as much as possible given I live alone. Great conversations while packing and both had such a great spirit (did I forget to mention it was 100 degrees outside - yikes!).

It has an easy to use interface allowing quotes to be created and sent to our customers easily, quickly, and with a professional look and feel.

It also keeps track of our inventory and notifies us when we are short of inventory allowing us to never double book rental items and integrates with Quickbooks for our book keeping.  We are so happy with it, we are going to ""upgrade"" to the Wishlist functionality.

I'd be even angrier if I wasn't so entertained by Nosegay's ridiculous solution to their mistake and poor judgement.

Lucy Meeks,We purchased a truck which was older but in decent shape. The price on the windshield was $5000 but our paperwork purchase price showed almost $2000 more with no explanation. The check engine light was on and we asked that it be checked. We were told it was an oxygen sensor. A week later we took the truck to AutoZone and the code was actually a knock sensor. Estimate to fix was $480. Today while mechanic started working on it the problem was actually discovered to be all eight cylinders misfiring. All coil wires and distributor need replacing for a cost of nearly $1000. I understand that it was purchased as is but it seems we were rushed into a purchase at the end of the day.

bob joe,"Sold me a car with NO AIRBAGS to turn a quick dollar.

I payed $3600 cash for a car from these scammers.

Drove it around, everything was fine except about 20 minutes into the ride home the ""chime"" started going off. (sound you hear when your door is still open or your seatbelt is not on).. It chimes 15 times and than stops for a while than it will start again when the car starts.

A google search says that the 15 beeps means that there is a problem with either the airbags or the instrument panel.

I found a mysterious bolt laying on the floorboard when i bought the car.
Open up the instrument panel to check, and low and behold the Airbag LED had been crushed with some tool probably needle nose pliers.

The bolt i had found on the ground was 1 of the 4 that holds the instrument panel to the dash (there was only 3 on when i opened it)- MEANING that Everage auto was fully aware that the vehicle did not have airbags - or there was an issue causing the Airbag check light to display, and they knew it would turn off a potential buyer so they sabotaged it.

Needless to say I took the car back and got my money back.
