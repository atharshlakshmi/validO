Joey Hunziker,"This review is based on the billing issues at Pahlavani dental. I received one notification in December 2018 about a bill in need of payment. I was confused, as I had changed jobs and therefore insurance, and hadn't visited Pahlavani dental in several months. I clicked through the email to see what the balance was due, but it showed me nothing. So I went on with my business.

Seven months later, I received a notification from a collections agency that Pahlavani dental sold that bill (which no one was still able to verify for me the amount). I called Pahlavani dental and they could neither confirm the amount nor who the creditor was, since they'd batch sold the debt. They were able to tell me that my insurance had retroactively denied one of their claims, which I was not notified about, and they were billing me for the service.

Gunnar Gustafsson,"(Translated by Google) Very happy with my first order of 5 sets of baby clothes from you that were nicely packaged in nice bags. Ordered for large size deliberately. To be sure they would fit. Several garments were finer than in the pictures. Glad I chose a larger size as clothes that are stated in months / age sizes instead of centimeters differ a lot.
Not happy with the company that delivered the package. Early Bird as they are called. They had put only half of the bag of clothes tucked in the mailbox - despite the fact that there was room to put the bag down completely. It was pouring rain outside. Anyone could have passed by and stolen the bag from the mailbox outside our plot. Would have preferred it to be delivered to the nearest agent where you can pick up your package yourself.

Mycket nöjd med min första beställning av  5 set babykläder från er som var fint paketerade i fina påsar. Beställde för stor storlek medvetet. För att vara säker att de skulle passa. Flera plagg var finare än på bilderna. Glad jag valde större storlek då kläder som anges i månader/åldersstorlekar istället för centimeter skiljer sig åt mycket.
Inte nöjd med företaget som levererade paketet. Early Bird som de heter. De hade lagt påsen med kläder endast till hälften nedstoppat i brevlådan - trots det fanns plats att stoppa ner påsen helt. Det ösregnade ute. Vem som  helst hade kunnat gå förbi och stjäla påsen från brevlådan utanför vår tomt.  Hade hellre velat att det levererats till närmaste ombud där man själv kan hämta ut sitt paket.",5,Valid,"translated by google very happy with my first order of  sets of baby clothes from you that were nicely packaged in nice bags ordered for large size deliberately to be sure they would fit several garments were finer than in the pictures glad i chose a larger size as clothes that are stated in months  age sizes instead of centimeters differ a lot
