Chris Morgan,"Julie is AMAZING! I have been researching different ways to heal from Lyme for over a year. My mother was clinically diagnosed with Lyme a year ago and it has been a LONG journey. Throughout the past year we have had different people and things placed in our path that has really lead us to the progress that we are seeing (total God thing in our opinion) and Julie and Clearlight are two of the things that fell right into place for us. Someone online recommended Julie to me, I reached out and right away could tell that she was a book of knowledge. I got her on the phone with my parents. Julie spent hours on the phone with them (my mom can ask a ton of questions) and not once did they feel pressured. The sauna was ordered and came in a couple of weeks ago. I actually just got off the phone with my mother prior to writing this review and she is already seeing improvements with her pain.

I didn‚Äôt have the money like so many others in the group. I thought I would have to wait until I came into some money before I could order one. Julie told me how some people get a credit card with 0% APR for 12 months to make it happen sooner. I applied and ordered through Julie and now I am able to begin healing today. Don‚Äôt wait and don‚Äôt skimp and get a cheaper sauna. This sauna is solid and incredibly well made. It goes together easily too. We are tight on space in this old farmhouse but we fit it in!!

Melissa Millner,"Our sauna got delivered to us 6 weeks ago, and we are SO glad we went with Clearlight and also with Julie.  We must have asked her questions on and off for over 6 months prior to being ready to purchase.  The being ready to purchase had more to do with cash flow than anything especially since Julie was SO prompt and thorough in answering our questions.  Prior to finding Julie - we had stopped at a few stores to ask questions about their saunas and we left knowing for certain that we would not purchase from them due to their lack of knowledge.  We've always felt like we've been in amazing hands with Julie.  Her knowledge is beyond what you can imagine.  After buying, there has been no drop off in her customer service either.  She still responds just as promptly and thoroughly!  So now that I've shared how much we appreciate Julie and how awesome she is at taking care of her customers, let me share my biggest health change since using the sauna.  So I suffer with CIRS (for me a combo of Lyme and mold issues) and virtually any time my heart rate came up at all (sometimes even just climbing a flight of stairs), I would get a horrible headache that would typically last the entire rest of the day.  Since starting with the sauna, I was able to shovel heavy snow for 1 1/2 hours straight 2 days in a row and NO headache either time.  It's seriously a miracle  I feel hopeful that I can once again start exercising!  I know more changes will come, and I do feel more energy during the day, so I'm excited to see what is ahead.  Thank you so much Julie!
